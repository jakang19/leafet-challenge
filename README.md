## Leaflet-Step-1
This script maps all earthquake data from the past 7 days based on magnitude (size) and depth (marker color).

This repository contains:
- The folder `static` with files:
  - `logic.js` containing Leaflet code to plot all data points
  - `config.js` containing the API key for geojson requests
  - `index.html` for webpage code
  - `style.css` for webpage styling
